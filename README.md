# 🚀 Codeforces Visualizer

Codeforces Visualizer is a sleek and interactive frontend web application built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to give a clean and insightful visualization of a Codeforces user's problem-solving performance.

### 👁️ What It Does (Current Features)

This tool fetches real-time data using the official [Codeforces API](https://codeforces.com/api) and displays:

- 🔍 **User Profile Summary**
  - Handle, rank, rating, max rating/rank
  - Country and organization (if available)

- 📈 **Rating Progress Chart**
  - A line chart showing the evolution of the user's rating across contests
  - Visualizes growth over time using `recharts`

- 🥧 **Submission Verdict Breakdown**
  - A pie chart representing the frequency of different verdicts like:
    - ✅ Accepted (OK)
    - ❌ Wrong Answer
    - ⏱️ Time Limit Exceeded
    - 🛠️ Compilation Error
    - ⚠️ Runtime Error
  - Helps analyze consistency and mistake patterns

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Competitive programmers often want to **visually track** their journey on Codeforces — not just their rating, but how well they’re doing in terms of:

- Accuracy of submissions
- Ratio of correct vs incorrect attempts
- Contest performance over time
- Number of problems solved for a specific topic

Instead of going through Codeforces’ raw tables, this tool provides **visual storytelling** with graphs and charts.
